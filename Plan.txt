Lab I, part I
=============

1 Propagation, run wave propagation on 2 different models (simple layered and SEG/EAGE)
1.1 For layered model (3 layers, 100x200) with shot from middle of the surface,
    compare analytical and experimental travel time to selected reflectors (deliverable 1)
1.2 For complex synth model (SEG/EAGE salt model) with shot from any source location
    take screen shots every n time and make sense of it (explanation in terms of face, amplitude, location)
    (deliverable 2)

2 Acquisition, run modeling with 2 different models x 2 different acquisition geometries
* geom 1: 3 even spaced shots and 10 even spaced sensors each (onshore)
* geom 2: 3 shots with 10 "towed" sensors each (offshore)
2.1 Show (screen shot) pre-stack CMP gather x shot (deliverable 3)
2.2 Compare gathers to recorded travel times (only layered model) (deliverable 4)

3 Illumination, run illumination on 2 different models
3.1 Using 1-5 shots, produce images incrementally (deliverable 5)
3.2 Make sense of illumination maps, identify main model features and
    locations, compare to velocity model (deliverable 6)

Lab I, part 2
=============

1. Imaging (RTM), run migration on the models provided in Part 1
1.1 For layer model (3 layers, 100x200) check location of main reflectors (deliverable 1)
1.2 For complex synth model (SEG/EAGE salt model) explain the image in terms of main reflectors 
    and shadows (lack of reflectors) in comparison to the velocity model (deliverable 2)
1.3 Try different combinations of shot numbers, iterations and peak frequency (deliverable 3)

2. Illumination (source and receiver), run migration on the models provided
2.1 Using 1-10 shots, produce illumination map incrementally (deliverable 4)
2.2 Compare to the source and receiver illumination to the velocity model
    and seismic image (deliverable 5)

Bonus: if you create/use a different velocity models and repeat and report the experiments, 
this will grant 20% of the exam.

Deliverables should be written in a report (pdf format), and send by email to
